When someone accesses EpicReads, my friend's online bookstore hosted in Finland, their device sends a request over the internet. The request is broken into small pieces called packets using packet switching, allowing data to take different paths for faster delivery. Each device on the internet has a unique IP address, so these packets know exactly where to go. The TCP/IP protocols ensure the packets are sent, received, and reassembled correctly, providing reliable communication. When a user opens EpicReads in a browser, it uses HTTP or HTTPS—the secure version of HTTP—to request web pages from the server. HTTPS encrypts data to keep information safe. Thanks to this system, users anywhere in the world can load my friend’s website quickly and securely.
